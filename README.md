Greek Shell Aliases
===================

I frequently need to organize dirs/files with greek characters. Switching the
keyboard layout isn't always successful, so I end up with errors like the
following:

```
âžœ ÏˆÎ´
zsh: command not found: ÏˆÎ´
```

I got tired of them, so I decided to create aliases of known shell commands
with greek characters!

How to use
----------

Just source the following file:

```bash
source path/to/greek_shell_aliases/greek_shell_aliases.sh
```

... and enjoy your new shell commands like `ÏˆÎ´` and `Î»Ïƒ` ðŸ˜º
